        Hello Sked Social ðŸ‘‹ <br><br>
        I saw youâ€™re looking for full stack developer at flexjobs.com and Iâ€™m interested in joining your team.
        Luckily, I begin to use MEAN stack to do projects since 2013, that's why I apply your job.
        <br><br>
        Best regards <br>
        Junyong Zeng â€” A FULL-TIME freelancer who work remotely since 2013.
